# Kickstart-mantrajs-webpack

Kickstart a project with Meteor, Mantra, React and FlowRouter fast!

1. git clone https://github.com/mantrajs/kickstart-mantrajs-webpack.git
1. cd kickstart-mantrajs-webpack
1. npm install
1. meteor

You can try [other kickstart projects](https://github.com/thereactivestack/kickstart) with ReactRouter, FlowRouter or Redux.

# Hot Module Reload (HMR)

Mantra prefers to use stateless (bare) react components. These components do not support HMR. If you want to use HRM, you need to use standard React components:

```javascript
// NO support for HRM
const Navigations = () => (
  <div>
    <b> Navigations: </b>
  </div>
);

// FULL Support for HRM
class NewPost extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <div>Text</div>;
  }
}
```

# Production
You can use meteor run, meteor build, mup or anything working with Meteor.

## Run in production mode
`meteor run --production`

## Build for production
`meteor build .`

## Deploy with Meteor-up
`mup deploy`

# Cordova
You need to do those 3 steps to make it works with iOS or Android:

1. Add the platform to your Meteor project

    ```javascript
    meteor add-platform ios
    meteor add-platform android
    ```
1. Allow access to your dev server in your `/mobile-config.js` file:

    ```javascript
    App.accessRule('http://192.168.1.100:3500/*');
    ```

1. Replace localhost by your local ip address in `webpack.json`.
